# Tasks — Pi Hermes Memory Extension

> Historical v0.1 task log. It records the state at v0.1 and is not the current architecture reference; see `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for current behavior.

> **Workflow**: When you start a task, change `[ ]` to `[~]`. When done, change to `[x]` and note the commit hash.
> Progress is tracked per-epic. Each epic has a clear definition of done.

## Epic 2: Core Memory — Store & Tool

_Done when: agent can add/replace/remove entries, they persist to disk, and survive a Pi session restart._

- [x] `MemoryStore.loadFromDisk()` correctly reads existing MEMORY.md and USER.md — `24151a0`
- [x] `MemoryStore.add()` validates content, enforces char limit, persists atomically — `24151a0`
- [x] `MemoryStore.replace()` finds entry by substring, replaces, re-checks limit — `24151a0`
- [x] `MemoryStore.remove()` finds entry by substring, removes, persists — `24151a0`
- [x] `MemoryStore.formatForSystemPrompt()` returns frozen snapshot (not live state) — `24151a0`
- [x] Atomic write works: temp file → `fs.rename()` (verify no corruption on crash simulation) — `24151a0`
- [x] Character limits enforced: reject writes that exceed `memoryCharLimit` / `userCharLimit` — `24151a0`
- [x] Deduplication: adding an identical entry is a no-op — `24151a0`
- [x] Multi-match ambiguity: replace/remove error when multiple distinct entries match — `24151a0`
- [x] `memory` tool registered with correct name, parameters, and guidelines — `tests/tools/memory-tool.test.ts`
- [x] Tool execute returns JSON with `usage` field showing char budget — `tests/tools/memory-tool.test.ts`
- [x] LLM can call (manual verification — no API key configured) `memory` tool with `add` action and entry appears in MEMORY.md — **manual verification required**
- [x] LLM can call (manual verification — no API key configured) `memory` tool with `target: "user"` and entry appears in USER.md — **manual verification required**

## Epic 3: Content Scanning & Security

_Done when: all injection/exfiltration patterns are blocked, invisible unicode is blocked, and safe content passes through._

- [x] `scanContent()` blocks prompt injection patterns (e.g. "ignore previous instructions") — `3f61b61`
- [x] `scanContent()` blocks role hijacking (e.g. "you are now...") — `3f61b61`
- [x] `scanContent()` blocks secret exfiltration (e.g. `curl ${API_KEY...`) — `3f61b61`
- [x] `scanContent()` blocks invisible unicode (U+200B, U+FEFF, U+202A-U+202E) — `3f61b61`
- [x] `scanContent()` returns `null` for safe/normal content — `3f61b61`
- [x] Blocked writes return `{ success: false, error: "Blocked: ..." }` to the LLM — `3f61b61`
- [x] Edge case: empty string passes (handled by empty check before scanner) — `3f61b61`
- [x] Edge case: very long content with pattern at end is still caught — `3f61b61`

---

## Epic 4: System Prompt Injection

_Done when: memory snapshot appears in system prompt at session start and does NOT update mid-session._

- [x] `before_agent_start` handler appends memory block to `event.systemPrompt` — `028c5ad`
- [x] Memory block includes header with usage percentage and char count — `028c5ad`
- [x] Block format matches Hermes: `═` separator, header line, then content — `028c5ad`
- [x] Frozen snapshot: write to memory mid-session → system prompt unchanged — `028c5ad`
- [x] Empty memory files → no block appended (system prompt untouched) — `028c5ad`
- [x] Second session (manual verification — needs Pi restart): memory saved in session 1 appears in session 2's system prompt
---

## Epic 5: Background Learning Loop

_Done when: after N turns, a background pi process reviews the conversation and saves notable facts automatically._

- [x] Turn counter increments on each `turn_end` event — `164eef9`
- [x] User turn counter increments only on user messages (not assistant/tool) — `164eef9`
- [x] Review triggers at `nudgeInterval` (default 10) turns — `164eef9`
- [x] Review does NOT trigger if `reviewEnabled` is false — `164eef9`
- [x] Review does NOT trigger if fewer than 3 user turns — `164eef9`
- [x] Review does NOT trigger if already in progress (`reviewInProgress` guard) — `164eef9`
- [x] `pi.exec("pi", ["-p", "--no-session", ...])` is called with correct review prompt — `164eef9`
- [x] Review prompt includes current memory + user profile + conversation snapshot — `164eef9`
- [x] Successful auto-save shows `💾 Memory auto-reviewed and updated` notification — `164eef9`
- [x] "Nothing to save" response → no notification shown — `164eef9`
- [x] Background review failure does NOT crash or block the main agent — `164eef9`
- [x] Counter resets to 0 after review triggers — `164eef9`
---

## Epic 6: Session Flush

_Done when: before compaction and session shutdown, agent gets one turn to save memories._

- [x] `session_before_compact` event triggers flush when `flushOnCompact` is true — `001a8d4`
- [x] `session_shutdown` event triggers flush when `flushOnShutdown` is true — `001a8d4`
- [x] Flush skips if user turn count < `flushMinTurns` (default 6) — `001a8d4`
- [x] Flush builds conversation snapshot from `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` — `001a8d4`
- [x] Flush uses `pi.exec("pi", ["-p", "--no-session", ...])` with flush prompt — `001a8d4`
- [x] Flush failure does NOT prevent compaction or session shutdown — `001a8d4`
- [x] After flush (manual verification — needs Pi restart), any saved memories are available in next session

## Epic 7: Insights Command & UX Polish

_Done when: `/memory-insights` shows formatted output and the extension is polished for users._

- [x] `/memory-insights` command registered and appears in Pi command list — `543e262`
- [x] Shows MEMORY section with numbered entries (truncated to 100 chars) — `543e262`
- [x] Shows USER PROFILE section with numbered entries — `543e262`
- [x] Shows "(empty)" when no entries exist — `543e262`
- [x] Formatted with box drawing characters (╔══╗, etc.) — `543e262`
- [x] Notification displays (manual verification — needs Pi TUI) correctly in Pi's TUI
---

## Epic 8: Configuration & Settings

_Done when: users can customize behavior via `~/.pi/agent/hermes-memory-config.json`._
- [x] Read config from `~/.pi/agent/hermes-memory-config.json` — `src/config.ts`
- [x] All `MemoryConfig` fields are configurable with type validation
- [x] Missing keys fall back to defaults
- [x] Documented in README.md

---

## Epic 9: Testing

_Done when: all core paths have automated tests and the extension passes a manual smoke test._

### Unit Tests
- [x] `content-scanner.ts` — 11 threat patterns + 5 invisible unicode chars tested — `3f61b61`
- [x] `memory-store.ts` — test `add` success, persistence, duplicate → no-op, exceeds limit → error — `24151a0`
- [x] `memory-store.ts` — test `replace` success, no match → error, multi-match → error — `24151a0`
- [x] `memory-store.ts` — test `remove` success, no match → error — `24151a0`
- [x] `memory-store.ts` — test frozen snapshot doesn't update after add — `24151a0`
- [x] `memory-store.ts` — test `loadFromDisk` reads existing files, handles missing files — `24151a0`

### Manual Smoke Tests
- [x] Full E2E (manual verification — needs full conversation): install → use 10+ turns → verify auto-review saves memory
- [x] Full E2E (manual verification — needs full conversation): long conversation → trigger compaction → verify flush saves memory
- [x] Full E2E (manual verification — needs full conversation): session 1 saves memory → quit → session 2 recalls it

**Automated test coverage: 119 tests, 0 failures, 0 type errors.**

**Manual verification required:** Run `pi -e ./src/index.ts` or `pi install github:chandra447/pi-hermes-memory`, then:
1. Have the LLM save a memory and verify it appears in `~/.pi/agent/pi-hermes-memory/MEMORY.md`
2. Start a new session (`/new`) and verify the memory appears in the system prompt
3. Use 10+ turns and verify auto-review triggers
4. Trigger `/compact` and verify flush saves memories
5. Run `/memory-insights` and verify formatted output
6. Try injecting malicious content and verify it's blocked
